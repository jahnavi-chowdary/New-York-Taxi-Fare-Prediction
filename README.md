# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
Performed exploratory data analysis and modelling on NYC Taxi Dataset. Used methods like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression to build the prediction model.
The following tasks have been performed.

Task 1:
--------

1.1) Explain what you did to clean the data. List each step/method as a separate item.

Task 2:
--------

2.1) Pearson correlation between Euclidean distance and the taxi fare

2.2) Pearson correlation between time of day and distance travelled

2.3) Pearson correlation between time of day and the taxi fare

2.4) Which has the highest correlation?

Task 3:
--------

3.1.1) Visual plot depicting the relationship between the distance of the ride and the taxi fare

3.1.2) Comment on whether you see non-linear or any other interesting relations (based on 3.1.1)

3.2.1) Visual plot depicting the relationship between the time of day and distance travelled

3.2.2) Comment on whether you see non-linear or any other interesting relations (based on 3.2.1)

3.3.1) Visual plot depicting the relationship between the time of day and the taxi fare

3.3.2) Comment on whether you see non-linear or any other interesting relations (based on 3.3.1)

Task 4:
--------

4.1) An exciting plot of your own using the data set that you think reveals something very interesting

4.2) Explain what it is, and anything else you learned. (based on 4.1)

Task 5:
--------

5.1) What additional features can you create? List each feature as a separate item.

Task 6:
--------

6.1) What are the coefficients for your model? What variable(s) are the most important one? 

6.2) How well or bad did the model do? Make sure to discuss your error metrics.

Task 7:
--------

7.1) Give bullet points explaining all the data sets you could identify that would help improve your predictions

7.2) List any external data sets that you were able to use in your analysis. (in bulleted form)

Task 8:
--------

8.1) Did you use any new features from an external dataset? If so, source the location and name them.

8.2) Did you preprocess the features further? If so, what did you do?

8.3) Did you try different machine learning models? List all that you tried and which performed the best.

8.4) Did you note any improvements from any of the changes you made above? Elaborate your thoughts on any improvement or lack thereof.
